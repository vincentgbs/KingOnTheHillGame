            King on the Hill is a simple game, where you try to get your king on top of a hill. Each player begins with one king and two pawns. On your turn, you must move one piece and build with the moved piece.
            <br/><br/>There are four levels: base, middle, top, cap. You want your king placed on top of the third level (top).
            <br/>You may move your piece to any adjacent square (including diagonals). You may build on any adjacent square (including diagonals).
            <br/>When moving, you cannot move to a space where another piece resides. You cannot move onto a cap. You cannot move up more than one level at a time. You may move down multiple levels.
            <br/>When you build, you cannot build on a square where another piece resides. You cannot build on top of a cap. There is no limitation on the level you can build at: you can be on the ground and build a cap.
            <br/><br/>The king has a special ability: when moving, it can swap places with an adjacent pawn that it controls (same team).
